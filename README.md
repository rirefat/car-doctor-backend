# Car Doctor Backend

This repository contains the backend code for Car Doctor, a web application for managing and maintaining vehicle information. It is built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, and provides various features for managing vehicles, repairs, and maintenance records.

## Features
The Car Doctor Backend offers the following features:

- User authentication and authorization: The backend includes functionality for registering new users and logging in existing users using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication and authorization.

- CRUD operations: The backend provides Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for managing vehicles, repairs, and maintenance records. This allows users to add, view, update, and delete vehicle and repair information as needed.

- Search functionality: The backend includes search functionality that allows users to search for vehicles, repairs, and maintenance records based on various criteria, such as vehicle make, model, and repair type.

- API endpoints for statistics and reports: The backend exposes API endpoints for retrieving statistics and generating reports on vehicle maintenance and repair history. This provides users with insights and analytics on their vehicle data.

- Integration with third-party API: The backend integrates with a third-party API for fetching vehicle information based on VIN (Vehicle Identification Number), which allows users to retrieve and store accurate vehicle details with ease.
